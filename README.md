Github repository: *github.com/movestore/Add_Corine_Landcover2018*

## Description
Annotates your data with Corine Landcover Classes (version 2018) and (if selected) provides usage proportions (need timelag attribute). Note that this only works for tracks in Europe, as Corine landcover is only available there.

## Documentation
This App uses the Corine Landcover 2018 100m resolution gif and annotates it to all locations of the data set. The Corine raster is clipped to the tracks first and then projected to longitude/latitude. For each location the landcover class of the one grid cell that is lies in, is appended. For more details on the data see: https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover/clc2018. A barplot and map is provided for each track and overall.

If selecting the optional `stats`, the App calculates usage statistics of each track and overall of all used landcover classes and returns them as .csv file.
